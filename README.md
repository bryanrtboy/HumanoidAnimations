# HumanoidAnimations

Project to Test and Store Humanoid Animations based on Unity standard assets and VR samples. The goal is to have a simple, working scene with 1st and third person controllers set up, and an AI waypoint example.

There are two scenes, one shows AI and Third person controls based on Unity Examples - Locomotion and Mecanim Example Scenes. The other is a screen test where I've brought in a couple of Carnegie Mellon .fbx animations to create a 'Screen Test'. You can click on a button and see the animation, click on a slider to set weights for upper and lower body animations and a toggle to have the character look at a target object.

The package included can be imported directly and includes all the animations, plus the basic scripting functions. Excess scripts are kept to a minimum, but it includes the Crossplatform inputs so that the third person character can be controlled by various input devices.
